# _CESCO_ EXPRESS 
**_I. Domain Description:_**

_CESCO_ or Centro de Servicios al Conductor is the local Department of Motorized Vehicles for Puerto Rico. It provides services to customers regarding the management, registration, and provision of licenses. The Department consists of staff including general management, workstation employees, vehicle inspectors, etc. Customers can come in and receive their turn on-site, or they can use the online platform to obtain their turn beforehand. The location has several sites for different functions, a section where the workstation employees can attend customers, which can, in turn, work different documentation, such as license permits or vehicle registration. There’s also an area where staff can meet and discuss matters regarding work. Another space is the registry where paper documents not yet converted to digital are.

**_II. Current Situation:_**

_CESCO_ is the only system that can help people with problems that involve the Motorized Vehicle, because of this problem the department has a massive amount of people that are looking for a solution. Most of the time when you get to this place you have to wait for an average of more than two hours to just then be told by the manager of the area inside the office the following: “You need more documents” or “This is not the required document”. Additionally, other times you are waiting in a place sent by personnel of the _CESCO_ to just be told that they can’t help you with the problem in that particular area you waited in. As a general problem view, the _CESCO_ isn’t organized with the different departments and does not have good communication with the people that are visiting the building.

**_III. Needs:_**

There is a need for a system that can make the everyday _CESCO_ appointment needs more efficient and less tedious while giving attendees the opportunity to prepare for their appointments and even reserve turns before getting to the _CESCO_ and avoid unnecessary trips to multiple government agencies for papers. Implementing such a system would streamline _CESCO_ appointments and avoid mistakes in document provision, existing fees, and more.

**_IV. Ideas:_**

+  Implement an easy user-friendly system where both employees and customers can find the services they need to be streamlined.
+  _Main Features:_
    + User accounts and with designated roles and permissions.
    + Soliciting turns online for on-site appointments.
    + A simple and easy to navigate website.
    + Display of available services with the required documentation.
    + A database would be available for various uses.

**_V. Scope:_**

The setting of the problem is the lack of automation in the services provided by _CESCO_. Developing a system to help with appointments can accelerate the process for employees and attendees. For example, finding certain documents needed for aspects like the driver’s license, in particular, is very tiresome since it requires going into multiple government agency offices just to find the needed documents. As a result, by having a system that facilitates the retrieval and finding of documents, people with needs of official information can avoid long waiting lines in the designated _CESCO_ offices.

**_VI. Span:_**

Creating a system where _CESCO_ attendees can find necessary procedural information beforehand and complete part of the processes without having to visit the offices. This helps employees speed up the process of the attendees while also cutting the time the attendees spend on waiting lines.

**_VII. Concepts:_**

+ Forms
+ Signatures
+ Stamps
+ Images
+ Social Security Card
+ Drivers License
+ Service Terminals

+ _CESCO_ workers: Consists of anyone from the receptionist to the janitors who work inside the _CESCO_ offices.
+ Attendees: People who need _CESCO_ services.
+ Developers: People working in the creation and deployment of the system.

**_IX. Assumptions and Dependencies:_**

+ _Assumptions:_
    + _CESCO_ wants to speed up the process.
    + Customers have the required facilities to obtain the necessary documents beforehand.
    + Customers have the required knowledge to print and scan documents.

+ _Dependencies:_
    + Connection to _CESCO_ PR database or some other formal database, in order to be able to access documents needed.
    + Computer networks need to have stable internet access.

**_XI. Synopsis:_**

_CESCO_ provides services to customers regarding the management, registration, and provision of licenses. This is the only system that can help people with problems that involve the Motorized Vehicle. Because of this, the department has a massive volume of people creating long wait lines and poor service. There is a need for a new system that can make the _CESCO_ appointments and the necessary document searching more efficient and less tedious. The root of the problem is the lack of automation in the services provided by _CESCO_. Implementing an easy user-friendly system where both employees and attendees can find the services they need to be streamlined, soliciting turns online for on-site appointments display of available services with the required documentation would be some of the measures to enhance this system. Our goal is to have faster attendance by implementing a better, more reliable, system that gives the users easy access and retrieval of the needed documents, or official information needed by the attendee/customer. By doing this wait time will decrease and visiting multiple offices for different documents will be eliminated.
